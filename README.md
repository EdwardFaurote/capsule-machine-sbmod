# capsule-machine-sbmod
Small mod made as a test/request.

Using a mock-Starbound structure (for organization, agreed upon by modders for ease of understanding),
this mod adds an object that dispenses loot containers, containing game loot and added novelty prizes.

Using a modified scripted interface, the machine itself outputs a random colored capsule, each one of which
has a specific prize double weighted, a chance at all other prizes, and then a small chance at in-game upgrades.
